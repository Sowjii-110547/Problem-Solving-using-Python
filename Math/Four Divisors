""" Description: 
You are given an array of integers.
For each number in the array:
Find all of its positive divisors
If the number has exactly four distinct divisors, add the sum of those divisors to the final answer
Ignore numbers that do not have exactly four divisors
Return the final sum.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [21,4,7]
Output: 32
Explanation: 
21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [21,21]
Output: 64

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
