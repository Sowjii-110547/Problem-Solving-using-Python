""" Description:
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:
Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.
Example 1:
nums = [5, 8, 3]
k = 4
Explanation:
Sum = 5 + 8 + 3 = 16
16 % 4 = 0
Example 2: 
nums = [3, 7, 2]
k = 5
Explanation:
Sum = 12
12 % 5 = 2
We need to subtract 1 for two times (from any numbers) to make the sum = 10
10 % 5 = 0
"""

nums = [3,9,7]
k = 5
s=sum(nums)
print(s%k)
# if sum divisible by k, it returns zero 
# else if sum doesnot divisible by k, it leaves a remainder that tells how many times 1 need to get subtracted.
