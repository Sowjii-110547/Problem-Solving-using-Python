""" Descrption: 
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Explanation:
The strings s and t can be made identical by:
Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

Example 2:
s = "badc", t = "baba"
Output: false
Explanation: 
b->b
a->a
d->b
here b is already mapped to b so i cant allow to map another alphabet like 'b so it returns false
"""
Source code:
s = "badc"
t = "baba"
dictt={}
used=set()
for i,j in zip(s,t):
    if i in dictt:
        if dictt[i]!=j:
            print("false")
            exit()
    else:
        if j in used:
            print("false")
            exit()
        dictt[i]=j
        used.add(j)
print("true")

Source code-2 :
s = "paper"
t = "title"
a=set(zip(s,t))
print(len(a)==len(set(s))==len(set(t)))
