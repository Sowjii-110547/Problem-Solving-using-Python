"""description: 
* sorted() syntax :  sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)
* sorted() by default sorts tuples by the first element, not "alphabetically" specifically. Since your first element is a character, it appears alphabetical.
* "key=" in the syntax says that "on what basis should i sort?.
* lambda x: x[1]
      each tuple in the list goes to the lambda function. As we have coded x[1], lambda function works on freqency. 
* reverse=True 
      we want a key with highest frequency first so, we coded reverse=True. This aligns the list of tuple in descending order based on the value frequency.
