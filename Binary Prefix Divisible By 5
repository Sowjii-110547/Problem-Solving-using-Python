"""
Description:
You are given a binary array nums (0-indexed).
We define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).
Return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false]
Explanation: The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.
Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.
