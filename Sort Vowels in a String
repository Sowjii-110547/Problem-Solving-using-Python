""" Description:
You are given a string s. You need to rearrange it into a new string t by following these rules:
Consonants don’t move → They must stay in the exact same positions as in the original string.
Vowels get sorted → Take out all vowels (a, e, i, o, u in both uppercase and lowercase), sort them by their ASCII values (uppercase come before lowercase), and put them back into the vowel positions.
Finally, return the new string.

Example 1
Input: "lEetcOde"
Vowels: E, e, O, e → sorted: E, O, e, e
Put them back into vowel spots → "lEOtcede"

Example 2
Input: "lYmpH"
No vowels → nothing changes
Output: "lYmpH"
