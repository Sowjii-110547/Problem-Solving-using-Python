""" Description: 
Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n 
such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.
Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.
Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
