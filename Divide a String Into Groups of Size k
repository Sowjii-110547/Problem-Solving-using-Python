""" A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:

The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each element can be a part of exactly one group.
For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
Example: 
Input: s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = "x"
Output: ["abc","def","ghi","jxx"]
Explanation:
Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups "abc", "def", and "ghi".
For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
Thus, the 4 groups formed are "abc", "def", "ghi", and "jxx".
