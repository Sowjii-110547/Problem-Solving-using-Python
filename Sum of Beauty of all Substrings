"""Description: 
The beauty of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.
For example, the beauty of "abaacc" is 3 - 1 = 2.
Given a string s, return the sum of beauty of all of its substrings.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aabcb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.
