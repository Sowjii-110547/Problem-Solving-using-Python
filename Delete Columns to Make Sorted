""" Description:
You are given an array of strings strs, where all strings have the same length.
Place each string on a new line to form a grid.
Each vertical group of characters forms a column.
A column is sorted if its characters are in alphabetical (lexicographical) order from top to bottom.
Your task is to count how many columns are not sorted and must be deleted.
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
  cba
  daf
  ghi
Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column.

Example 2: 
Input: strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The grid looks as follows:
  zyx
  wvu
  tsr
All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3.

strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]

for col in range(len(strs[0])): # iterate column wise
    for row in range(len(strs)-1): # iterate row wise
        if strs[row][col]>strs[row+1][col]:
            count+=1
            break            # stop checking this column
print(count)
